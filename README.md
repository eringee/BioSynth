# Song_of_Seven2021
 2021 upgrade to Song of Seven
 
 Requires Teensy Audio library

To do: 

1) Import initial Teensy Audio Library conditions and test audio on the board
2) Attach biosignals to individual tones
3) Create a definition at the top of the file for saying whether this is box 1-7 (each box plays different tones)
4) Develop UI that greets user with which box version it is, then allows to switch to each "section" of the musical score, to change tones
5) Develop additional UI that automatically fades in / out tones when button pressed - or install the A15 pot?  Not clear yet
